Creating a complete BASIC interpreter in Go is a complex task, but I can guide you through the basic structure and components you would need to implement such an interpreter. This example will not cover every detail of a full BASIC interpreter, but it will provide a foundation that you can build upon.

Here's a simplified version of what such an interpreter might look like:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"bufio"
	"os"
	"strings"
	"strconv"
)

type Program struct {
	lines map[int]string
}

func NewProgram() *Program {
	return &Program{
		lines: make(map[int]string),
	}
}

func (p *Program) AddLine(number int, code string) error {
	if _, exists := p.lines[number]; exists {
		return fmt.Errorf("line %d already exists", number)
	}
	p.lines[number] = code
	return nil
}

func (p *Program) Run() error {
	for line := range p.lines {
		code := p.lines[line]
		fmt.Printf("Executing line %d: %s\n", line, code)
		// Here you would parse and execute the line of code
		// For simplicity, we'll just print it out
	}
	return nil
}

func main() {
	p := NewProgram()
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)

	fmt.Println("Enter lines of BASIC code (type 'run' to execute):")

	for scanner.Scan() {
		input := strings.TrimSpace(scanner.Text())
		if input == "run" {
			break
		}
		parts := strings.SplitN(input, " ", 2)
		if len(parts) != 2 {
			fmt.Println("Invalid line format. Expected 'line_number code'")
			continue
		}

		lineNumber, err := strconv.Atoi(parts[0])
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Invalid line number: %s\n", parts[0])
			continue
		}

		err = p.AddLine(lineNumber, parts[1])
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
		}
	}

	if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error reading input:", err)
		return
	}

	if err := p.Run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error running program:", err)
	}
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Program Structure**: The `Program` struct holds a map of line numbers to their corresponding code.

2. **Adding Lines**: The `AddLine` method adds a line of code to the program. It checks if the line number already exists and returns an error if it does.

3. **Running the Program**: The `Run` method iterates over the lines in order and executes them. In this simplified version, it just prints out each line.

4. **Main Function**: The main function reads input from the user until 'run' is entered. It then parses the input to extract line numbers and code, adds them to the program, and runs it.

### Features Not Implemented:

- **Parsing and Execution of BASIC Statements**: This example does not parse or execute BASIC statements. A full interpreter would need a parser to break down the code into tokens and an executor to run the logic.
  
- **Variables and Expressions**: Support for variables, mathematical expressions, conditionals (IF), loops (FOR/NEXT), and subroutines (DEF FN) is not included.

- **Error Handling**: While basic error handling is present (e.g., duplicate line numbers), a full interpreter would need more robust error checking.

- **Line Number Management**: The example assumes lines are entered in order. A real interpreter might handle out-of-order input and allow for editing of existing lines.

This is a starting point, and building a fully functional BASIC interpreter would require expanding on these concepts with additional features and functionality.
